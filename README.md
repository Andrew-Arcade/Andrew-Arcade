> Help Needed: Integrating Onshape Files into Repository
>   - I'm currently using Onshape for my designs and would like to include these files in this repository. Is there a way to achieve this so that others can open the project files directly in a desktop application on their computer? Any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated!
